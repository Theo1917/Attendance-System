# Attendance-System
This project implements an efficient and scalable attendance management system using Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) principles, and Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (DSA). The system allows instructors to record, track, and manage student attendance while leveraging key concepts of OOPS and DSA 
Major Features:
Student Management: Students can be added, edited, and deleted.
Tracking of attendance: Each student's attendance for each day is tracked and kept in easily accessible format.
Data Storage: Student and attendance data are maintained efficiently using the appropriate data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and hashmaps.
Search and Sort: Algorithms for search and sort have been implemented in order to find students or their attendance quickly.
Reporting: Attends reports and statistics are created for individual students or entire classes.
Technologies Used:
Core Programming: Java
Object-Oriented Programming: OOPS principles
Data Structures: arrays, linked lists, hashmaps
Algorithms: searching, sorting
This application shows how one can develop an attendance system that is robust and efficient using Java's OOPS features combined with DSA techniques, to be used for educational institutions or any other place where people would require attendance records.
